Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
The two model architectures, 'vgg' and 'resnet' classified as rottweiler which is the SAME breed with the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg. The 'alexnet' model architecture classified as tibetan mastff which is NOT the same breed with original dog breed in Dog_01.jpg. So, the model architectures can classify the SAME breed are 'vgg' and 'resnet'.



2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
The 'resnet' model architecture classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as rottweiler, therefore, the 'resnet' model classified as the same breed for this two images. The classified breed is also the same with original breed in images.

The 'alexnet' model architecture did NOT classify as the same breed for the two images, because 'alexnet' classify Dog_01.jpg as tibetan mastiff and Dog_02.jpg as kelpie, and not even same with original breed.  

Since the 'vgg' model architecture classify Dog_01.jpg as rottweiler and Dog_02.jpg as miniature pinscher, 'vgg' model did NOT classify as the same breed for the two images. But the model classified Dog_01.jpg as the same with original dog breed.



3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All the three model architectures classify Cat_01.jpg and Medicine_bottle_01.jpg with ClassLabelDog value '0' and also their pct_correct_notdogs is 100%. Therefore, the three models correctly classified Cat_01.jpg and Medicine_bottle_01.jpg to not dogs.



4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on my answers above, I found that the 'resnet' model architecture is the best. The 'resnet' model classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as rottweiler which is also the same breed with original breed in images. The model can also classified not-dog-images to be not dogs. I also found the total runtime of the model is 0:0:0 which is quite fast. These are the reasons why I selected 'resnet' as the best model architecture for uploaded image classification.
